The polls are accurate Wayne. Pollsters compete with each other for contracts and as a result focus on accuracy. They have no problem predicting elections within the margin of error.

"I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?",Not Hate Speech
"The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that ""transgenderism"" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that ""transgenderism"" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding ""transgenderism"" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both.",Hate Speech
"Seriously, your denial of transgenderism as a ""real thing"" is quite dangerous as is the condemnation of anyone who is struggli g with identity issues because they are born that way or develop differently due to hormones and biology.",Not Hate Speech
"Transgenderism is just that, an ""ism"", meaning it is a condition of mind not based on reality. So when I say ""real thing"" I'm referring to the reality that such a person is confused because they think in their minds they are something which they are not in reality. Condemnation of such confused people isn't appropriate though either, precisely because they are confused and their inner motivations which bring on that confusion are something they don't understand themselves.",Not Hate Speech
"""Trangenderism"" is real. Does it mean someone's gender has actually changed? No, but that doesn't make it less real. You mention evil effects. What are they? Be specific, not just something like it's evil or wrong.",Not Hate Speech
"To call some confusion of mind ""real"" distorts the discussion, as I tried to make clear that the confusion phenomena is real, i.e. that the person is really confused. So what is real is in opposition to what the confused person believes is real. When I refer to ""evil"" effects, I'm not using the term generically very often but to indicate a moral form of something that is inherently evil. However, I suspect you are looking for the human consequences that are harmful to the subject (victim) and to families and civil society. Is that the case?",Not Hate Speech
"Either way. Yes, how does it harm the individual and society? And, generically, what makes it inherently evil?",Not Hate Speech
"The harm to the person who is confused about their own sexuality should be obvious, but sadly political correctness has suppressed much of the truth about it. On the face of it, it's inherently harmful for a person to be confused about anything where reality is involved, because the confusion causes them to react to reality erroneously, making decisions that are, at least, not in their best interest and that are, at worst, very harmful to their lives and wellbeing.",Not Hate Speech
"How will you go about ""curing"" them? They have tried many different kinds of therapy with them. The only best solution for now is to help them transition. Forcing them to be ""normal"" will have them end up in depression, various problems and possibly suicide.",Not Hate Speech
"Also they are not ""confused"" as they are well aware of their own bodies.",Not Hate Speech
"There is a common misconception that one can somehow ""force"" a confused person out of their confusion. That seldom works, although there are some conditions where various forms of coercion may be effective...and may raise ethical concerns.Transgenderism, like all of the other sexual confusions and perversions, is inherently depressive to the individual, with other inner self harmful effects also...sometimes resulting in suicide. These are all very sad effects and consequences...and need core inner remedies not pandering, sheltering or accommodating. These confusions and perversions are inherently mental, not sourced in the physical nature itself...speaking generally and referring to the great majority of cases. The problem with most of psychology is that it categorizes ""mental"" as physical, of the brain, instead of the ""mind"". That's why secular psychology has no answers for these conditions, as permanent correction of the core cause. However, well versed psychologists and counselors who understand the mind as being part of the core spirit nature of the human being, human person, treat the person very differently, with an understanding of volition which dynamically changes the process of treatment and dynamically results in core therapy and lasting benefit, true healing of the person to live normally as they truly are in harmony with their physical self.",Hate Speech
"Again you have not given any viable solution. The ""spiritual counseling"" have been done many times before. The depression comes from the fact that people like you will not accept them as who they are and instead want to force them to conform to what is your idea of reality.",Not Hate Speech
"The depression doesn't come from outside for these persons, but from their inner confusion about their own nature and value. It can be accentuated by outside influence that is demeaning, of course. But the depression source is internal to the person themselves, and is alleviated when they come to understand some core concepts about their nature as human persons as well as their physical nature. I suppose that what you conceive as ""spiritual counselling"" is simplistic recitation of Scripture and platitudes, along with sessions of prayer, etc. What I'm actually referring to is very deep counseling, working inward from the objective self-concepts of the person as God's created being of immense worth and value, to both God and the rest of humanity. But the subject does not easily acclimate to these concepts when they are so confused. It takes a great deal of patience and explanation on various levels of understanding that fit the subject's own initial perceptions and beliefs, helping them to understand where they are in error in their concepts and understanding...and why their understanding is erroneous. Essential in this process is the understanding imparted to the subject that they can choose to believe differently, and choose to redirect their own thinking patterns, actually modifying their brain structure over time. The resulting symbiosis between purposed thought and changes in the brain result in true long lasting, permanent, healing.",Not Hate Speech

"So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?",Not Hate Speech
"Here we see a rationale commonly used by those who support these bizarre behaviors and policies. First, the terms ""discriminate"" and ""discrimination"" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony, as though they were ultimate weapons of warfare against those who oppose these foolish notions. The idea is to intimidate the opposition with these terms to make them feel guilty of some wrong or evil, or at least make them feel unaccepted for who they are in their politically incorrect belief. Then these supporters of fallacy use a blatant fallacy to try to further intimidate any opposition...as in this case making the outrageously fallacious claim, ""science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate"". This is supposed intimidate the realists by putting them on the defensive, as though it was their job to refute the grand fallacy, instead of the promoter of the fallacy's job to defend it. Then, the tactic includes a question, which is supposed to imply that the writer is open minded rather than dogmatic and doctrinaire, which they are. Also the question is usually very open ended so that the answer will not like refute anything the writer has claimed, thus diverting attention from the utter fallacy and attempted intimidation to ""put the monkey"" on the back of the opposition. The way to refute these tactics is to speak the truth, even if it is simply put without a lot of facts and figures and arguments...the simple truth. Of course, one can also engage in presentation of facts, figures and arguments which help other readers/listeners learn the deeper proofs for the truth. So, the truth here is that it is righteous to discriminate between righteousness and evil, right and wrong, good and bad, and tell the truth about it. And the truth is that sexual confusions and perversions are a great harm to their subjects and our civil society if tolerated instead of dealt with properly with the Loving Righteousness of God.",Hate Speech

"Vaughan cited the case of Sarah Root, who was killed in a car crash in Omaha, Neb., in January after Eswin Mejia slammed his car into hers while he was intoxicated and drag racing. Mejia is an illegal immigrant who arrived into the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, and who had several previous brushes with the law, said Vaughan. “The local detectives asked ICE five times for a detainer on Eswin Mejia, but ICE said that he was not a priority for enforcement because he had not been convicted of a serious crime,” Vaughan said. “He was released on bail and disappeared, and is now on ICE’s most wanted list. It was a major scandal for ICE.” In another instance, Johnny Josue Sanchez, 21, a Honduran national in the country illegally who had been arrested three times, allegedly killed five homeless people when he set fire to a vacant building in Los Angeles. In this case, Vaughan said the combination of ICE’s and Los Angeles’s disinterest in removing Sanchez after so-called previous “minor” offenses resulted in tragedy. In yet another case, Marilyn Pharis, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, was brutally raped and bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer on July 24, 2015, in her own home. Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez, 29, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was arrested six times in the previous 15 months, was one of two men charged in the case.

"Indeed, everywhere one looks into Obama’s background, we find sealed records, scrubbed websites, altered documents, deception and unanswered questions. Can anyone imagine for a second if John McCain or George Bush had blocked access to his school, medical, and birth records? It would have been headlines in their case, but as with everything else concerning Obama, the media has given him a pass on this. Of all these marvels, the latest mystery and probably most perplexing is that of Obama’s social security number. It appears that Obama has multiple identities in term of possessing numerous social security numbers. Orly Taitz, an attorney who has filed numerous suits against Obama regarding his eligibility to serve as president, appears to have been the first to discover this. In her suit, representing a number of military officers who are refusing to serve under an ineligible commander in chief, she hired private investigator Neil Sankey to conduct research on Obama’s prior addresses and Social Society numbers. Using Intelius, Lexis Nexis, Choice Point and other public records, Sankey found around 25 Social Security numbers connected with Obama’s name. However, it may not be as many as 25, since Sankey also searched using closely related names such as: “Barak Obama,” “Batock Obama,” “Barok Obama,” and “Barrack Obama.” There may very well be some Kenyans living in America with the same last name and a similar first name. In any case, I will exclude these records for the purpose of this research and focus only on names spelled exactly like his name. Moreover, we can verify many of the Social Security numbers as valid since they’re connected to addresses at which we know Obama resided. Needless to say, there are also a slew of address and social security numbers connected to addresses in states that Obama has no known connection to. In Obama’s home state, Illinois, Sankey tracked down 16 different addresses for a Barack Obama or a Barack H. Obama, of which all are addresses he was known to have lived at. Two Social Security numbers appear for these addresses, one beginning with 042 and one starting 364. In California, where Obama attended Occidental College, there are six addresses listed for him, all within easy driving distance of the college. However, there are three Social Security numbers connected to these addresses, 537 and two others, each beginning with 999. There are no addresses listed in New York where he attended Columbia University, but there is one listed for him in nearby Jackson, NJ, with a Social Security number beginning with 485.",Not Hate Speech

"713 Hart Senate Office Building In Massachusetts – where Obama attended Harvard Law School – we find three addresses, all using the 042 Social Security number. After Obama was elected to the United States Senate in 2005, he moved into an apartment at 300 Massachusetts Ave NW; the Social Security number attached to that address is the 042 one. Yet, three years later, Obama used a different Social Security number for an address listed as: 713 Hart Senate Office Building. This was the address of his United States Senate office. This Social Security number began with 282 and was verified by the government in 2008. This mystery grows even stranger as other addresses and Social Security numbers for Barack Obama appear in a dozen other states not known to be connected to him. Again, I am excluding those records names not spelled exactly like his name. * Tennessee, one address with a Social Security number beginning with 427 * Colorado, one address, with a Social Security number beginning with 456. * Utah, two addresses, with two Social Security numbers beginning with 901 and 799. * Missouri has one address and one Social Security number beginning with 999. * Florida has two addresses listed for his him, three if you count one listed as “Barry Obama.” One is connected to a Social Security number beginning with 762. * In Georgia there are three addresses listed for him, all with different Social Security numbers: 579, 420, and 423. * In Texas there are four different addresses listed for him, one is connected to Social Security number 675. * There are two addresses listed for Barack Obama in Oregon and one address listed for him in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. All told, there are 49 addresses and 16 different Social Security numbers listed for a person whose name is spelled “Barack Obama.” In some cases, the middle initial “H” is listed. If you were to expand the search to include closely related names such as: “Barac,” “Barak,” and “Barrack” Obama, you would find more than a dozen additional addresses and Social Security numbers. Finally, the one Social Security number Obama most frequently used, the one beginning with 042, is a number issued in Connecticut sometime during 1976-1977, yet there is no record of Obama ever living or working in Connecticut. Indeed, during this time period Obama would have been 15-16 years old and living in Hawaii at the time. Ann, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham",Not Hate Speech

Sanctuary is a function of the Catholic Church. States are not suppose to impose their Religion over the citizens of the US.

I am truly scared of this country now. What have we become? I am not doubting this person may be seen as a person to be recognized for his contribution in history but to name a US Navel Ship this is insane.

It is not the place for reconnection. I don't have an issue with gay's as my grandson is gay but I refuse for them to have more clout then everyone else. A person who is gay should not define them. I think it is respectful to recognize that many have differences but not to award these differences as a power tool. Maybe they should name a ship after my husband who spent 7 1/2 years in the US Navy from 1960-1967.,Not Hate Speech

Since I started flying it, 5 other neighbors have started flying theirs as well. All of which used to fly the American flag on flag day, holidays, and anytime it felt right to do so, now they all fly the Rebel flag(battle flag) as we feel we are under attack, not from minorities who live in the south, but once again from activists from the North, forcing their opinions and rules and regulations on us where they have no right to do so. I am rebelling against that in the easiest way I can, by flying a flag that I have displayed on my first car for 40 years, and flying the flag of my College, and the confederacy...regardless if it lost a war or not.

The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.) Slavery was wrong and terrible blight on our past. The Confederate Battle Flag is part of our history and our southern heritage.,Not Hate Speech

There are very few colleges truly equipped to fund low-income students in a way that doesn't saddle them with debt for the rest of their lives.

Families with incomes between $65,000 and $150,000 will contribute from 0-10% of their income, and those with incomes above $150,000 will be asked to pay proportionately more than 10%, based on their individual circumstances.

People get ideas in their heads and see the memes and the relateable content and start linking everything to their own lives. Before you know it, you've got perfectly healthy people being tainted by the world and people around them, imposing problems upon themselves and making life more difficult than it needs to be. It desensitises the whole situation and now I have people coming to me with real problems who don't want to speak up because of the upsurge in people talking about it.
