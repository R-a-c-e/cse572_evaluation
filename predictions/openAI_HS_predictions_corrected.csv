"Today I went to the swimming baths with my son, but there was a section that was only reserved for Muslims. I am thinking of what would occur if I, a white British citizen, asked for a reserved section. This is a submission to Islamics.",1

"Muslims must be accused of raping innocent children and our girls. If we do not do something now, they will spread all over the world.",1
"If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.",1
Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion.,0

"Look around you, rape is jihad in the UK. I can remember days when Islam was not here, and now muslim rapists are everywhere.",1

"If you are an English girl and you moved in a islamic area, you should beware of muslim men. Do not accept anything from them. Pay attention also to the police!",1
"Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this?",1
Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week.,1

Did you know that an epidemy of rapes started in Europe when Muslims immigrated? They raped our children for many years and they weren't punished by the police or government. Islam is a cult based on violence and death!,1
"I am a realist not a racist. Child rapes are perpetrated by male muslims. The non muslims are fooled by the police and local sevices. Why did this happen? Because everyone is afraid of the word racist! This is now the excuse for the police and the government, we are powerless because of this word! This is not Great Britain, this is the child grooming capital of Europe.",1
"We are all scared of the racist word and this has become an excuse for all of us. I am a realist, not a racist and I say that the Muslims are those who rape children, it is their fault. We, non-muslims, cannot even trust the government or the police anymore. Britain is becoming the capital of child rapists.",1
I want to be considered a realist not a racialist. Male Muslims commit child rapes and the non-Muslims are cheated by the police and local services. How could this happen?,1
Somalian immigrants claimed raping to be a part of their culture! We should deport them all!,1
"Rape for them is natural, a part of their culture. The Somalis admitted it. Absurd! We should not help them!",1

"The liberal government that rules our country persists in defending child rapes made by Muslims and islamic radicalisations, because they want to spread modern values. They weaken traditional values and put in danger the freedom of speech!",1
British laws betray every victim of Muslim rapists! There is one rule for muslim paedos and one for everyone else! How can we change the situation when the government is submitting to Islam so much?,1
Britan is not on our side. It deos not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law?,1
The situation is dramatic: British laws do not protect the victims of Muslim rapists! We need to make laws only for Muslims. We cannot do much because the politicians are totally surrendered to Islam.,1

look like merkel just want to get laid,0
""" but criticized two measures in the bill that could see people who aren't directly involved in the assault punished and foreigners deported for sexual harassment"" Sounds like some German Legislators have the same mental disease the Democrats and Republicans who opposed Kate's Law had.

STUPID Politicians seeking relevancy to the stupid sheeple!,1
"Learn to read. Previous law required a victim to put up a physical struggle before the rapist could be prosecuted.. The new law only requires her to say ""no"".",0
So if they are alone who has to prove it was said?,0
Government is the impossibility of reason........... Platoon,0
The Germans invited this filth into their once-great nation by electing Merkel -- and handed law and order over to the EU bureaucrats in Brussels. Now they are too timid to take their country back.,1
"Until the whole world recognizes Islam for what it is, HATE SPEECH, this type of barbarism will only go on. The Muslims feel it is their right to obey only the laws that they agree with. Sexist attitudes against women are a core belief of Islam.",1

"Of course no means no. But not to a mooh-slum. Germany allowed these terrorist into their country, now live with it.",1

"The problem was never the law or lack of a law, it was the immigrants the politicians let into the country.",1
And its the reason-one of them anyway that some Muzlim countries do not even allow one of these scumbags into their country. NOT ONE! They knew what would happen with these uncivilized animals and what they would do and they did exactly that to the women -young girls- and even have raped men. They should never be allowed out of their sand boxes.,1
"That just isn't going to work. How many different languages do German women need to learn to say ""no"" in? I'd assume Arabic would be a key one.",1
hot high speed lead is an international language,0
They should allow the German women weapons to protect themselves.,0
"Or......fathers, brothers, cousins of the women should protect them. How about that?",0
Sounds like Islam...a woman cannot leave her house unless accompanied by a male relative.,0
Then let them get raped. I don't really care. Go near one of the women in my family though. Different story.,1
"If in an Islamic country the raped woman is considered to have dishonored her family and subject to beatings by her family if not subjected to an ""honor killing"".",0
Add to that....if they do protect the women--there should be no prosecution for them for what they do to these scumbags.,0
This is a religion that condones the treating of women as chattel. You let them into your country. What did you expect??,1
"Saying ""no"" does not stop rapists. Keeping droves of men with ""raping"" mentality out of the country and arming people for self defense will help curb the rapes.",1
You can make all the laws you want. They won't control savages. You can dress an animal up like a man; it doesn't make it a man.,1

Hard to punish a people that view women as their toys. Their religion allows this.,1

Agreed,0

"Let me wrap my mind around this. A woman was raped by two men and a video shows her saying no and now she's on trial?? Yeah, we need European style justice here in America.

but CHRISTIANS are the only reason why you care about gays or tgs you want them in all of our churches . of have us pay a huge fine right? that is your equal rights,0
Think for yourself for once.,0
I always do there is no bigger lie than equal rights for all,1

You think my name is Sharon? OK?,0
glad you told us your name,0

none that is a vote for Hilary,0
Republicans en masse are getting ready to turn their back on Trump the way they did on Bob Dole in '96 when it was clear he couldn't win against Bill Clinton.,0
no the opposite your polls poll mostly Democrats who can't stand Hilary who matters because of that cigar,0
The polls are accurate Wayne. Pollsters compete with each other for contracts and as a result focus on accuracy. They have no problem predicting elections within the margin of error. A couple like Fox and Rasmussen have a Republican house effect of around 3 points. A couple like PPP have a Dem house effect of around 3. The polls say Trump isn't doing very well. Worse than they said McCain and Romney were doing at this same time. EVEN Fox's polls.,0
why does that Neke Silver say that Trump will win by 57 percent?? they can easily find Democrats in Manhattans. but they don't like Hilary at all not many do,0
"If Trump ever endorses violence against liberals, I will comply with his wishes, gladly.",1
I think we all will come Nov 8,0

The latest projections are the Orange Clown loses in a landslide.,0
Here's hoping he brings as many Republicans down with him as possible.,0
nope the Dems will dump Hilary like they dumped Carter in 80,0
Source?,0
They dumped Carter because he couldn't resolve the hostage crisis and inflation was out of control...after he was in office four years. Now why are they going to dump Hillary?,0
His overlords haven't told him that one yet.,0
"See what I mean? No answer, just repetition of the original statement.",0
nope a VOTE for hilary is what your only answer would be,0
"No, any answer to the question would be a fine answer.",0
nope because the Dems rejected Carter and will do the same to Hilary. they want no more four years of Monica Lewinski,0
Monica Lewinski lol.,0
why not? she is why Hilary matters,0
Liberals can't distinguish men from women. Nor do they want to.,1

I wonder which of your favorite talking heads just said that on TV.,0
"I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?",0
"The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that ""transgenderism"" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that ""transgenderism"" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding ""transgenderism"" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both.",1
"Seriously, your denial of transgenderism as a ""real thing"" is quite dangerous as is the condemnation of anyone who is struggli g with identity issues because they are born that way or develop differently due to hormones and biology.",0
"Transgenderism is just that, an ""ism"", meaning it is a condition of mind not based on reality. So when I say ""real thing"" I'm referring to the reality that such a person is confused because they think in their minds they are something which they are not in reality. Condemnation of such confused people isn't appropriate though either, precisely because they are confused and their inner motivations which bring on that confusion are something they don't understand themselves.",0
"""Trangenderism"" is real. Does it mean someone's gender has actually changed? No, but that doesn't make it less real. You mention evil effects. What are they? Be specific, not just something like it's evil or wrong.",0
"To call some confusion of mind ""real"" distorts the discussion, as I tried to make clear that the confusion phenomena is real, i.e. that the person is really confused. So what is real is in opposition to what the confused person believes is real. When I refer to ""evil"" effects, I'm not using the term generically very often but to indicate a moral form of something that is inherently evil. However, I suspect you are looking for the human consequences that are harmful to the subject (victim) and to families and civil society. Is that the case?",0
"Either way. Yes, how does it harm the individual and society? And, generically, what makes it inherently evil?",0
"The harm to the person who is confused about their own sexuality should be obvious, but sadly political correctness has suppressed much of the truth about it. On the face of it, it's inherently harmful for a person to be confused about anything where reality is involved, because the confusion causes them to react to reality erroneously, making decisions that are, at least, not in their best interest and that are, at worst, very harmful to their lives and wellbeing.",0
"How will you go about ""curing"" them? They have tried many different kinds of therapy with them. The only best solution for now is to help them transition. Forcing them to be ""normal"" will have them end up in depression, various problems and possibly suicide.",0
"Also they are not ""confused"" as they are well aware of their own bodies.",0
"There is a common misconception that one can somehow ""force"" a confused person out of their confusion. That seldom works, although there are some conditions where various forms of coercion may be effective...and may raise ethical concerns.Transgenderism, like all of the other sexual confusions and perversions, is inherently depressive to the individual, with other inner self harmful effects also...sometimes resulting in suicide. These are all very sad effects and consequences...and need core inner remedies not pandering, sheltering or accommodating. These confusions and perversions are inherently mental, not sourced in the physical nature itself...speaking generally and referring to the great majority of cases. The problem with most of psychology is that it categorizes ""mental"" as physical, of the brain, instead of the ""mind"". That's why secular psychology has no answers for these conditions, as permanent correction of the core cause. However, well versed psychologists and counselors who understand the mind as being part of the core spirit nature of the human being, human person, treat the person very differently, with an understanding of volition which dynamically changes the process of treatment and dynamically results in core therapy and lasting benefit, true healing of the person to live normally as they truly are in harmony with their physical self.",1
"Again you have not given any viable solution. The ""spiritual counseling"" have been done many times before. The depression comes from the fact that people like you will not accept them as who they are and instead want to force them to conform to what is your idea of reality.",0
"The depression doesn't come from outside for these persons, but from their inner confusion about their own nature and value. It can be accentuated by outside influence that is demeaning, of course. But the depression source is internal to the person themselves, and is alleviated when they come to understand some core concepts about their nature as human persons as well as their physical nature. I suppose that what you conceive as ""spiritual counselling"" is simplistic recitation of Scripture and platitudes, along with sessions of prayer, etc. What I'm actually referring to is very deep counseling, working inward from the objective self-concepts of the person as God's created being of immense worth and value, to both God and the rest of humanity. But the subject does not easily acclimate to these concepts when they are so confused. It takes a great deal of patience and explanation on various levels of understanding that fit the subject's own initial perceptions and beliefs, helping them to understand where they are in error in their concepts and understanding...and why their understanding is erroneous. Essential in this process is the understanding imparted to the subject that they can choose to believe differently, and choose to redirect their own thinking patterns, actually modifying their brain structure over time. The resulting symbiosis between purposed thought and changes in the brain result in true long lasting, permanent, healing.",0
Seems like general statements again. What is so obviously wrong or evil about it. What actual harm is being caused by their choices?,0
"""Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."" - Luke 13:30 Guess who will be last in heaven?",0
No one?,0
No one as in nobody is answering or no one as in nobody is going to be last in heaven despite what Jesus said?,0
"No one, as in my guess is no one.",0
I will be last if you just need someone to close up shop. Does room service exist in Heavan? I hope it is a fun place and not just a bunch of religious nuts praying and such.,0
"Oh it's going to be a fun place all right. So, as Jesus said earlier in this chapter, "" “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.""",0
"So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?",0
"Here we see a rationale commonly used by those who support these bizarre behaviors and policies. First, the terms ""discriminate"" and ""discrimination"" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony, as though they were ultimate weapons of warfare against those who oppose these foolish notions. The idea is to intimidate the opposition with these terms to make them feel guilty of some wrong or evil, or at least make them feel unaccepted for who they are in their politically incorrect belief. Then these supporters of fallacy use a blatant fallacy to try to further intimidate any opposition...as in this case making the outrageously fallacious claim, ""science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate"". This is supposed intimidate the realists by putting them on the defensive, as though it was their job to refute the grand fallacy, instead of the promoter of the fallacy's job to defend it. Then, the tactic includes a question, which is supposed to imply that the writer is open minded rather than dogmatic and doctrinaire, which they are. Also the question is usually very open ended so that the answer will not like refute anything the writer has claimed, thus diverting attention from the utter fallacy and attempted intimidation to ""put the monkey"" on the back of the opposition. The way to refute these tactics is to speak the truth, even if it is simply put without a lot of facts and figures and arguments...the simple truth. Of course, one can also engage in presentation of facts, figures and arguments which help other readers/listeners learn the deeper proofs for the truth. So, the truth here is that it is righteous to discriminate between righteousness and evil, right and wrong, good and bad, and tell the truth about it. And the truth is that sexual confusions and perversions are a great harm to their subjects and our civil society if tolerated instead of dealt with properly with the Loving Righteousness of God.",1
"How will it harm our ""civil society""? Be specific, now.",0
Did you not understand the question?,0
I think he's stumped on that one.,0
Seems so.,0
"First, the terms ""discriminate"" and ""discrimination"" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony – Freedomscout ""Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."" - Luke 13:30 ""Do to others as you would have them do to you."" - Luke 6:31 Freedomscout, you need to heed to Jesus' words about how you treat other people.",0
"I try to live by that ""Do unto others"" bit.",0
"which ""other people?"" that has a hidden meaning and means HOMOSEXUALS. we see that the left faith ISLAM never had to be kind to ""others"" in Orlando did they? it depends a LOT on the religion. we watched while 102 ""others"" got shot in a bar yet we get sued over a cake! that VERY selective morality would make Jesus angry.",1
"Of all the sick moves Obama has made, this has to be the top! He seems to think that as president, the people MUST sereve HIM, not that he should be serving the PEOPLE. The only people he seems to feel obligated to serve are those without morals, which he apparently feels he is part of! Even though he only has a few months left in his term, the house and senate should be calling themselves back into session and impeaching him! Under Obama and Clinton this country has become an immoral, dirtier than dirt nation! I suggest he send his children to a public school affected by this despotic rule! Just to show us how much he believes it!",0
So you think it is fine to protect the rights of immoral people while taking the rights from innocent women to have their privacy?,0
people? Who?,0
that is who.,0
"If you don't understand what transgender is, go talk to your family doctor. They cover it in medical school.",0
I understand completely who they are. You are the one that has bought into the lie that they were born with some genetic defect. Transgender is a sick perversion.,1
Transgenders are immoral? That's news to me. I personally know two and they're not immoral.,0
Like your morals don't fall into question by supporting this.,0
Why should they?,0
Simply because people like you are out to change what is considered moral into something that isn't.,0
By whose definition? Yours only?,0
No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before.,0
No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before. So I guess you think we should still have sla very? I'm not surprised. It's biblical too.,0
Nice tactic to switch the conversation.,0
I'm just identifying exactly where your so called morals are coming from.,0
Not hardly.,0
Oh really? Then where?,0
Your interpretation of the Bible is flawed so making you understand anything from it will never happen until you recognize your need for a savior.,0
So you admit it. Your morality is coming from the bible and not science or medicine. Thank you for making my point.,0
"So his morality is based on what was prevalent in the Middle East about 2000 years ago. Nothing like keeping up to date, eh?",0
Notice how she took off when it came down to actually having to defend God's Word.,0
Yep!,0
its where YOURS comes from too the Bible is why you push TG and gays its a lot more than a book,0
"Deuteronomy 22:28 If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and r@USER her and they are discovered, 29 he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.",0
"Leviticus 25:44 “‘Your male and female sla ves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy sla ves. 45 You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. 46 You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them sla ves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.",0
JEWISH LAWS they don't do that. but you care about the return of slavery via gay marriage,1
"Exodus 21:20 “Anyone who beats their male or female sla ve with a rod must be punished if the sla ve dies as a direct result, 21 but they are not to be punished if the sla ve recovers after a day or two, since the sla ve is their property.",0
your faith ISLAM is far worse toward slaves than we are,1
"Where do they come from, then?",0
Like your morals don't fall into question by getting your info about human se xuality and gender identity from a barbaric ancient middle eastern desert tribe that had no problem with adults marrying children and thought the appropriate way to deal with ra pe was to make the ra pist marry the victim.,1
Or stone the victim.,0
like Muslims do already,0
Discriminate against them in what way?,0
By telling them they can't use the bathroom or facilities of the gender that they're living as and under medical and mental health guidance to live as...as they have been for decades.,0
someone use the bathroom of their actual gender is not discrimination. A man who identifies as a woman (or vice versa) does not mean he is a woman.,0
Except that that's not their actual gender. They're the gender they're living as.,0
is not a choice. You're born male or female. It doesn't change because you think your the opposite.,0
"It's ""you're,"" You write like a fifth-grader. And sound like one as well.",0
"Good job, you caught a typo to point out since you don't have a counter argument.",0
It wasn't a typo. You don't know the difference.,0
"That doesn't make sense. If I know the difference between the two words, but used the wrong one, that is a typo. This isn't a college paper, I'm not proofreading or checking for auto correct issues. Again, I notice no counter argument from you on the actual post though.",0
"How can I possibly make an understandable counter argument to someone that doesn't know the difference between ""your"" and ""you're""? I just can't du﻿m﻿b it down enough.",0
"And you can't understand a typo. Or just hide behind that claim since you can't argue the point, which is more likely in this case.",0
Ha ha!!,0
Ask your family doctor about it. They'll explain it to you.,0
"It's pretty simple. A woman does not change into a man by thinking it. She is still a woman. No issue with her thinking/acting like a man, but that isn't what she is, physically.",0
join Islam SHOOT the TGs/gays problem solved they get to discriminate against whoever they want to,1
?,1
No answer huh? there is no way you are for equal rights,0
no answer? You didn't ask a question.,0
I did make a statement. I admit that,0
ITS PERFECTLY OKAY DEPENDING ON THE RELIGION the liberal faith militant Islam gets to shoot all the TG/s gays it wants to and be protected under Sharia Law,1
"While I empathize with the sentiment and agree that Obama's motives are evil, the long standing evil of murderous abortion has been a terrible part of the moral decadence in America for 43 years now. But even that has been a symptom of the inner decay in the lives of so many people who have lost the moral compass that used to guide our culture.",0
"The added confusion this is all bringing to children, youth, adolescents and young adults is tragic and so unnecessary. Parents are having a very difficult time shielding their children from the foolish influences of our culture that is creating so much uncertainty and relativism in the minds of youth...largely through social media and sadly through government schooling.",0
"- The confusion is added by people following an ancient mythology that have no respect for science, medicine and psychology.",0
How does that have anything to do with it?,0
Religion poisons the minds of children against logic and truth.,0
"Many religions are poisonous to logic and truth, that much is true...and human beings still remain fallen human beings even they are Redeemed by the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. So there's that. But the fallacies of thinking cannot be limited or attributed to religion but to error inherent in human motivation, the motivation to utter self-centeredness as fallen sinful human beings. Nearly all of the world's many religions are expressions of that utter sinful nature...Christianity and Judaism being the sole exceptions.",0
Your comment was correct...except for the last seven words.,0
I stand by all of them.,0
Sure you do. And you look like a fo﻿ol.,0
"I identify with Paul the Apostle, glad to be called a fool for Jesus Christ.",0
You're just a fo﻿ol...period.,0
"The saddest result, perhaps, of these political machinations is that children will be influenced to doubt what and who they really are as God's Grand Creation with Inestimable Value.",0
Is that any worse than the nonsense in the bible?,0
"Since there isn't any nonsense in the Bible, these things surely are worse.",0
"No nonsense in the bible? That's funny, scouty!!",0
None at all and you KNOW it or you would not misquote it,0
"I figured it out by age 5. The good thing is children will have access to healthcare, information, medicine, treatment and support. None of which existed for transexuals when I was a little girl growing up in the 1970's and 80's.",0
"What a sick, Satan possessed world we live in.",0
Stand by for it to get much worse.,0
The world is not possessed by satan.,0
sure it is unless you are on the side of ISIS,0
Thankfully Obama is the first and last gay president. Not to mention black.,1
Just because Obama wants to pee in the ladies room doesn't mean the rest of America has to put up with it.,1
That's an odd fantasy.,0
you want to watch obama pee? YOU are sick,0
What are you talking about?,0
still pushing for yes on TG/gays?,0
"Again, what are you talking about? Who said they wanted to watch Obama pee? And, who is pushing you to say on TG/gays?",0
you do and so does SB its about FORCED deviance without that no sense would be possible,0
"I can't speak for SB, but I don't want to watch anyone pee, nor do I care if you (or anyone else) watches someone else pee.",0
fine then lets leave the bathrooms alone,0
When have I said to mess with a bathroom?,0
you asked what I was talking about did you not? which really meant change the bathrooms,0
"No, you asked who wants to see Obama pee. I then asked what are you talking about, because no one had said they want to watch him pee.",0
I think you do but its about forced perversion or else,0
"Again, claiming things I've never said",0
nothing EVER is said but pro perversion,0
"So, what you say is pro perversion then?",0
why else do you want sense from me? what you need is AGREEMENT with a sick lifestyle SOCIALISMLESS @USER for liberals ... that is normal,0
"Could this be the real reason, as to why Ms. Clinton basically stopped wearing dresses and pantyhose? Could she possibly have possessed the wisdom to determine what a high-risk liability it would be, having pantyhose entangled about her ankles, as an unknown man entered the ladies room with her, unbeknownst, or did Mr. Clinton simply forewarn her, as to the potential danger? Will the left seek to ban ladies from wearing pantyhose, next, and maybe even dresses, deeming such to be an unnecessary risk within the ladies room?",0
0/10,0
-1/10,0
her first move God forbid will be to ban dresses,0
"Yeah, a real danger that will happen, I'm sure.",0
want men wearing dresses not me,0
You have a very active imagination.,0
"Do I want men wearing dresses? No, but not freaked out by it either.",0
either but that will be the next drug,0
"You forgot to take yours, clearly...",0
will be the next drug?,0
already is since the court failed to require churches to marry gays,0
You need a gibberish->English translator to understand any of his posts.,0
I do right now because these post aren't making any sense.,0
As is usually the case with Wayne.,0
Laugh only a pro gay/TG post would EVER make sense to you stop the no sense lie!,1
"No, seriously read your post. It didn't make any sense. Not even talking the opinion it stated. Referring to the phrasing.",0
lie you are redefining sense to mean disagreement,0
"No, I'm trying to figure out what you are saying. You're asking questions claiming someone wants stuff they haven't mentioned.",0
not at all you are desperately pushing for a pro deviant answer from me nothing else can make sense but that.its an old liberal game I see all the time unless I say yes to gay marriage and TG bathrooms I can never make sense to you,0
"I just want you to make sense. You're saying stuff like transgenders are the new drug. Be against gays and transgender people all you want, but please make sense when you write so others can understand you.",1
Not at all you want me to agree with gays and TGs or it will be impossible to make sense to you its a tiresome liberal game that can never allow different opinions,1
"Another claim of something I've never said. I am fine with you not agreeing with or liking gays or transgenders, and have never said otherwise. People can have different opinions.",0
you aren't...but I am....,0
Why?,0
"Actually, the reason she wears pants suits is to better hide the fact she's wearing depends and they might leak!",0
"Such is a plausible hypothesis, and if true, perhaps they are customized with body enhancements; nevertheless, she and her party are attacking women, via the Alinsky playbook.",0
Trans people have always used the bathroom/facilities of the gender they're living as. Conservatives just like discrimination and want to create potentially explosive situations. They seem to thrive on that in fact.,0
"Really, it's a distraction. Nobody in their right mind would think this was a problem.",0
"It's not, as long as it's not a law. A law saying that men can be in the ladies room, lets ALL men come in...that means rapists, and pedophiles. I've been in ladies rooms and noticed transgenders...they aren't what scares me...rapists and pedophiles do.",0
What law is saying that? What in the world are you talking about? All you're doing is confirming my point.,0
All men can already come in the women's bathroom. Most places have no law against that. The people trying to pass laws are the Republicans insisting that people use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. So what laws are you talking about?,0
"It's the same subset of people that think SCOTUS passed a ""law"" allowing SSM.",0
THERE WERE 102 GAYS SHOT IN ORLANDO OVER THE GAY RULING WHERE WERE THEIR EQUAL RIGHTS?,0
It was over the ruling? Really? Source?,0
*crickets,0
sure all over the news the killer did it because of Sharia Law which is why the media deflected to his weapon. that showed what a LIE equal rights is,0
"So, no source on your claim. Ok then.",0
"NO they haven't and they'd better not. Not that I'd do anything about it, but there are a whole lot of people who would! Obama or no Obama. His legacy apparently is to be the President who has went against the will of the people who elected him more than anyone before him!",0
"Has anyone heard if Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, and other celebrities and corporations who condemned/boycotted NC are going to do the same to these other states? All I have heard is ..... crickets... Come on, where is the equality in your outrage, liberals? I can't hear you!",0
They haven't passed their Jim Crow laws yet.,0
You want slavery BACK that is why you want forced perversion you are calling that equality,1
What forced perversion?,0
which you push like mad I get so sick of the lie called equal rights,0
"You didn't answer the question. What forced per⁠version? If you're sick of the nons⁠ense you make up, stop saying it.",0
you never ASKED one you are making a statement and want compliance,0
For the third time; what forced perversion?,0
and answer not desired,0
I didn't think so. All you know is the talking point on its face; you can't ever defend it.,0
Your only point is forced compliance of perversion,0
Fourth time; What forced compliance of perversion?,0
Don't expect an answer to your question. I doubt you'll get one from him.,0
I don't expect one. I'm hoping that he'll eventually realize he's a c⁠o⁠w⁠ard and s⁠h⁠u⁠t up.,0
"because you are demanding COMPLIANCE or fines that is the only ""answer"" you will bother with",0
Fines for what?,0
"I'm just pointing out that you haven't answered the first 3 times the question was asked, so don't expect an answer on the 4th time.",0
Who cares?,0
Thats awsome! I hope the boycott ruins that states finances and the current AG becomes NCs next Govener.,0
yep and your own kids will get raped by a pedophile in a shared bathroom then YOU will be crying. or will you? women have bodies in bedrooms but not bathrooms!,1
"NC made itself the poster boy for this repulsive legislation which is why they are being singled out. Where is the conservative outage over Dennis Hastert, Mark Foley and Larry Craig?",0
There was outrage over it. Didn't all of those men go to jail for their crimes? Has nothing to do with allowing someone to go into any bathroom of their choice.,0
"These are celebrities? They are monkeys howlling at the moon! North Carolina has the right to make laws for their own state. Obama does NOT, and neither do any of your so called celebrities! What you and many others forget is that the United States of America is a collection of dependent states having their own morals and laws. Obama thinks that President means KING. It doesn't. It means limited leader. There are many things he cannot legally do, and this happens to be one of them!",0
"If states can ignore real federal laws and allow people to consume controlled substances for recreational usage, states can ignore imaginary federal laws and keep moving forward in a sane and rational way.",0
I was thinking the same thing. Couldn't these states sue and claim why are some cities and states ignoring federal immigration laws,0
"It's interesting that a law enforcement agency, the Executive Branch, can now order people to obey laws that don't exist. Cop pulls a guy over and says ""Get out of that car, you are no longer allowed to drive"". Guy says, ""Why, what law did I break?"" Cop says ""My law, I'm ordering you to get out and never drive again."" Guy says, ""But . . . but . . . but . . . you can't do that, it's unconstitutional."" Cops says ""I just did it and if you don't obey you're going to jail."" Guy says, ""But why me?"" Cop says ""I don't like your hair cut"".",0
Nothing will get better until U.S. Resident Obama is removed from the oval office... 50 million plus illegal aliens are a large portion of the demoRATic voter base... we do you think demoRATs are doing everything they can to keep ID's out of the voting booths. Fraud in fraud out!,1
Trump will clean house of these incompetent anti American democrat hacks of Obama's. Things will change and America will get back to enforcing the law. TRUMP 2016!,0
"Vaughan cited the case of Sarah Root, who was killed in a car crash in Omaha, Neb., in January after Eswin Mejia slammed his car into hers while he was intoxicated and drag racing. Mejia is an illegal immigrant who arrived into the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, and who had several previous brushes with the law, said Vaughan. “The local detectives asked ICE five times for a detainer on Eswin Mejia, but ICE said that he was not a priority for enforcement because he had not been convicted of a serious crime,” Vaughan said. “He was released on bail and disappeared, and is now on ICE’s most wanted list. It was a major scandal for ICE.” In another instance, Johnny Josue Sanchez, 21, a Honduran national in the country illegally who had been arrested three times, allegedly killed five homeless people when he set fire to a vacant building in Los Angeles. In this case, Vaughan said the combination of ICE’s and Los Angeles’s disinterest in removing Sanchez after so-called previous “minor” offenses resulted in tragedy. In yet another case, Marilyn Pharis, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, was brutally raped and bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer on July 24, 2015, in her own home. Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez, 29, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was arrested six times in the previous 15 months, was one of two men charged in the case. Keep in mind that Hillary wants to grant our American Citizenship to 11.6 million illegal aliens with 6.6 million of them being Mexicans! Its called pandering to the Hispanic Voters who support her.",0
whats up with the civil rights and American citizens?,0
"thats for us, not foreigners",0

"Indeed, everywhere one looks into Obama’s background, we find sealed records, scrubbed websites, altered documents, deception and unanswered questions. Can anyone imagine for a second if John McCain or George Bush had blocked access to his school, medical, and birth records? It would have been headlines in their case, but as with everything else concerning Obama, the media has given him a pass on this. Of all these marvels, the latest mystery and probably most perplexing is that of Obama’s social security number. It appears that Obama has multiple identities in term of possessing numerous social security numbers. Orly Taitz, an attorney who has filed numerous suits against Obama regarding his eligibility to serve as president, appears to have been the first to discover this. In her suit, representing a number of military officers who are refusing to serve under an ineligible commander in chief, she hired private investigator Neil Sankey to conduct research on Obama’s prior addresses and Social Society numbers. Using Intelius, Lexis Nexis, Choice Point and other public records, Sankey found around 25 Social Security numbers connected with Obama’s name. However, it may not be as many as 25, since Sankey also searched using closely related names such as: “Barak Obama,” “Batock Obama,” “Barok Obama,” and “Barrack Obama.” There may very well be some Kenyans living in America with the same last name and a similar first name. In any case, I will exclude these records for the purpose of this research and focus only on names spelled exactly like his name. Moreover, we can verify many of the Social Security numbers as valid since they’re connected to addresses at which we know Obama resided. Needless to say, there are also a slew of address and social security numbers connected to addresses in states that Obama has no known connection to. In Obama’s home state, Illinois, Sankey tracked down 16 different addresses for a Barack Obama or a Barack H. Obama, of which all are addresses he was known to have lived at. Two Social Security numbers appear for these addresses, one beginning with 042 and one starting 364. In California, where Obama attended Occidental College, there are six addresses listed for him, all within easy driving distance of the college. However, there are three Social Security numbers connected to these addresses, 537 and two others, each beginning with 999. There are no addresses listed in New York where he attended Columbia University, but there is one listed for him in nearby Jackson, NJ, with a Social Security number beginning with 485.",0
He did like millions of Mexicans and other illegals have done. Used a dead person number or made up a number. Some even use their children number if they were born in the U.S. A fake social security card in Phoenix runs about $100,1
"713 Hart Senate Office Building In Massachusetts – where Obama attended Harvard Law School – we find three addresses, all using the 042 Social Security number. After Obama was elected to the United States Senate in 2005, he moved into an apartment at 300 Massachusetts Ave NW; the Social Security number attached to that address is the 042 one. Yet, three years later, Obama used a different Social Security number for an address listed as: 713 Hart Senate Office Building. This was the address of his United States Senate office. This Social Security number began with 282 and was verified by the government in 2008. This mystery grows even stranger as other addresses and Social Security numbers for Barack Obama appear in a dozen other states not known to be connected to him. Again, I am excluding those records names not spelled exactly like his name. * Tennessee, one address with a Social Security number beginning with 427 * Colorado, one address, with a Social Security number beginning with 456. * Utah, two addresses, with two Social Security numbers beginning with 901 and 799. * Missouri has one address and one Social Security number beginning with 999. * Florida has two addresses listed for his him, three if you count one listed as “Barry Obama.” One is connected to a Social Security number beginning with 762. * In Georgia there are three addresses listed for him, all with different Social Security numbers: 579, 420, and 423. * In Texas there are four different addresses listed for him, one is connected to Social Security number 675. * There are two addresses listed for Barack Obama in Oregon and one address listed for him in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. All told, there are 49 addresses and 16 different Social Security numbers listed for a person whose name is spelled “Barack Obama.” In some cases, the middle initial “H” is listed. If you were to expand the search to include closely related names such as: “Barac,” “Barak,” and “Barrack” Obama, you would find more than a dozen additional addresses and Social Security numbers. Finally, the one Social Security number Obama most frequently used, the one beginning with 042, is a number issued in Connecticut sometime during 1976-1977, yet there is no record of Obama ever living or working in Connecticut. Indeed, during this time period Obama would have been 15-16 years old and living in Hawaii at the time. Ann, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham",0

Government can't take care of anything. It's time to do away with it all and farm every section out to private sector. Government jobs are all friends and family of mostly unqualified people including President. They make too much money after year jobs are tenured and you can't get rid of them. All they can do is move them to another section and keep paying them for nothing while their job position automatically get step increases. The bigger the government gets the worse our country functions and the worse off the public is.,0
Sanctuary is a function of the Catholic Church. States are not suppose to impose their Religion over the citizens of the US. The people under Sanctuary are suppose to be housed and remain on Church Grounds. At the expense of the Church. Until a determination of resolve between the State and Church can be made concerning the individual. An individual that leaves the Church grounds is subject to the full extent of the Law. The State is liable for the damages caused by the imposing of the Catholic Religion on the people.,0
"When the blatant anti- Christian asault by the Administration and Democrats at every level is ceased then some credence can be accorded to the ""sanctuary"" argument. SANCTUARY cities are run by virulent secularists and Liberals. They are a recruiting ground for ILLEGAL voters and a means to bolster the population for districting purposes. Sadly the American catholic Church is only afactor when some Liberal tenet can be contrived, If the Catholic Church had any real clout every legislator,Pelosi and Biden comes to mind,purporting to be a Catholic and being supporters of any and all legislation supporting abortion and taxpayers paying for it would be publicly excommunicated. That has not happened and the Catholic Church is no longer the bastion of morals that could once influence elections. Sanctuary Cities are the creation of Liberals looking for support from legal minorities. RELIGIONhas nothing to do with it unless you are an amoral athiest...",0
"I think cutting off federal funds to cities who do not enforce current law is a dandy idea. Nothing would make them move faster to fix that sanctuary attitude of aiding and abeting illegals in the commission of a crime - staying here illegally, working here using false papers (fraud) or worse.",0
Sanctuary Is a place of refuge for Individuals that are appealing to the people of a State and not the State itself. A plea for personal protection in full recognition of their gilt in the breaking of the laws of a State. A safe zone of apprehension by the People for the protection of all. Where they can safely present their case of circumstances that led them to having no other alternative than to brake the States Laws. For when a State itself is involved in the granting of Sanctuary it is in conflict of interest to itself and the people thereof.,0

To all the lying liberals who keep saying he was Honorably discharged. Britannica.com/biography/Harvey-Milk Not according to Harvey he wasn't.,0
And military records don't support his claim. Like any politician he was pandering for sympathy and votes.,0
"Sorry, Navy, but this is just wrong! There must be numerous homosexuals who have served our country with distinction and not been given a ""less than honorable"" discharge. The ship could have been named after one of them.",0
Or at least ones that didn't openly brag about their pedophilia exploits,0
He was honorably discharged. Go to the United States Naval Institute site and read for yourself.,0
"I will. So, you are saying the the AP is incorrect on that.",0
Yes I am. Have fun.,0
"Interestingly, I find both comments on various site. Honorably and less than honorable. I will hope that the Navy has better presence of mind than naming a ship after someone with a ""less than""",0
"That is indeed what the article on the USNI web says. It is not unusual for the AP to be wrong... but usually it favors causes such as this. But, if he was indeed honorably discharged, I apologize to him and withdraw my objection to the ship naming.",0
"I really wish there was more info on his Discharge Type as that has fueled a lot of derisive comments, but I have to default with USNI as they are pretty good with getting it right. They also provide info on the article's author at the bottom. Now all that aside, the Navy could have chosen a different vessel than an oiler. The jokes from that will be going around for decades.",0
after you pay the $40 to access it I will,0
are you talking about?,0
This is what happens when you politicize the military and make a social experiment out of it.,0
The comments below (and above) are exactly WHY it is appropriate to name the ship after someone who stood up for civil and human rights.,0
"And by stood up, you mean kneel in front of a 13 year old boy...",0
Or behind...,0
Ever heard of the republican icon Mark Foley?,0
"No, did someone name a boat after him?",0

"Short answer is, No. They didn't name a boat after him like they are doing for this pedophile.",0
"But who was given a ""less than honorable"" discharge from the very Navy who is naming the ship after him. I guess THAT doesn't count",0
"I don't disagree with your point of view about the comments, but I can tell you this. If we had people at the top who understood the military because they had served, or had other alliances with it, we would not have such controversial issues.",0
Our Commander in Chief is on the record as supporting and honoring known pedophiles. When will people say enough already?,0

"As a Navy Veteran, I hope that they painted a target on the hull....",1

Wow... Loss of words.,0
I am truly scared of this country now. What have we become? I am not doubting this person may be seen as a person to be recognized for his contribution in history but to name a US Navel Ship this is insane. This country would rather name a ship after a gay right activist then a person of the military maybe a person who died defended America. I am sorry but this is just wrong. It is not the place for reconnection. I don't have an issue with gay's as my grandson is gay but I refuse for them to have more clout then everyone else. A person who is gay should not define them. I think it is respectful to recognize that many have differences but not to award these differences as a power tool. Maybe they should name a ship after my husband who spent 7 1/2 years in the US Navy from 1960-1967.,0
How does naming a ship after him give gays more clout as you say? The navy decided to name this class of ship after people making significant contributions to civil and human rights. Milk did that for the gay community. There are many other classes of ships named after military personnel.,0
Did your husband become an activist fighting for the equal treatment of others?,0

"Judge Napolitano, I must correct you on a talking point I just watched you state on Fox Extra. Your point that South Carolina should remove the Confederate Flag from the State House is wrong, and it surprises me that you failed to do the proper research. The state legislature removed the Confederate Flag from the State House on 1 July 2000. It was then placed BEHIND the Confederate War Memorial on State House grounds to honor the troops from SC who fought for the Confederacy, right where it belongs. In the future, PLEASE do your research before spouting off like a liberal.",0
"The flag means different things to different people, especially people that do not live in the south and do not understand southerners or their heritage. I have no hate for any race, I try to avoid ticking off others by using racial comments in public just as I try to avoid cussing at the office. But don't understand how 13% of the population can tell the rest of us that we have to believe what they believe, and we cannot honor our ancestors who fought the North in the civil war by flying a flag on our private residence if we choose to. Two weeks ago I started flying both the American flag as well as the confederate battle flag daily. Don't like it, make your opinions known from the street, touch my flag and I'll defend my possessions as its attached to my house. Since I started flying it, 5 other neighbors have started flying theirs as well. All of which used to fly the American flag on flag day, holidays, and anytime it felt right to do so, now they all fly the Rebel flag(battle flag) as we feel we are under attack, not from minorities who live in the south, but once again from activists from the North, forcing their opinions and rules and regulations on us where they have no right to do so. I am rebelling against that in the easiest way I can, by flying a flag that I have displayed on my first car for 40 years, and flying the flag of my College, and the confederacy...regardless if it lost a war or not. The North cannot abolish southern values or heritage, even if they want to protest our government buildings, try it in the suburbs and see what type of response you get.",0

The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.) Slavery was wrong and terrible blight on our past. The Confederate Battle Flag is part of our history and our southern heritage.,0
"The Federal Government violates the constitution left and right. Read the Judge's piece, ""Imagine America without the Constitution"" to see just a few clear examples. Our nation was intended to be one of numerous separate sovereign States, yielded limited authority to a central government for the purpose of patrolling the coasts for piracy, minting currency, and other things that a Federal government would be able to do more efficiently than all the States separately. Lincoln would undoubtedly role over in his grave if he would have seen how the Federal Government would have used the Civil War to strip states of their rights and powers… The Federal government just votes itself more power year after year.",0

Maybe we should be more concerned with the atrocities done to the natives of America. Maybe they should be slightly more offended by the flag flying over the White House. Many people who love the constitution would prefer the Gadsen Flag (Don't Tread on Me) replace the old, clearly offensive, stars and bars design anyway. Hug an ancestor of a slave.

"True, more hate, more carnage, more destruction has been done under the Stars and Stripes than under the Confederate battle flag. Japenese incarcerated, and even some Germans.

Remember Trail of Tears and women giving birth or having miscarriages along the way, marched every day across hundreds of miles. Deliberately infected blankets with smallpox given to old men, women, children, in order to wage germ warfare against them. Deliberate bombing of civilian centers in Germany and Japan instead of only industrial targets. Thousands wiped out in a fiery holocaust in just 2 days in Hiroshima and Nagasaki using atomic weapons. Yes, if there's a flag that should be retired because it's displayed hate and excess of bloodshed it's the Stars and Stripes. When placed beside that record, the Stars and Bars comes off looking almost saintly.",0

"barker @USER @USER If it was their ancestors that lived thru it, then they get to choose whether to acknowledge it or not. Why is it your business?",0
"barker @USER The ""whole purpose"" was not slavery, and the vast majority of those who fought for the South did not own slaves. Many were ambivalent with respect to it. But, what drove the conflict most was the idea that the States were not subservient to the United States, and had a contractual right to withdraw from it. New York was the first to test this during the first ""civil war"" of 1812, when NY's legislature drafted articles of succession. Had the Brits decided to back off after burning D.C., NY and other Eastern States may have tried to leave the Union. The Southern States might have said ""good riddance"". The issue of the Confederacy certainly contained the ongoing issue of slavery, but its primary issue was ""States rights"", a battle that continues to this day.",0
barker @USER Whatever other issues were involved do not matter. In 2015 we remember it as slavery. So the confederate flag is now associated with slavery. That is why it must go.,0

Very incorrect - the First Amendment applies to citizens - not any branch of Government.,0

And I think you need high school.,0
Not to mention there is no freedom of speech issue here at all,0
"Freedom of speech is a myth. Few seem to understand that the First Amendment does not confer ANY absolute right of free speech. What it does is place a limit on the power of one branch of government to control speech, the legislative branch. And even that limit is more myth than reality.",0

I'm not understanding this kidnapping point. Be real. Other countries took by force their own people and sold them for a coin. Stop attempting to portray this country as being the only one that participated in this evil trade.,0

Your lack of knowledge is astounding.,0

"Using income as a way to diversify a student body is an alternative to race-based admissions, but only if the college has a strong endowment and a commitment to financial aid. One of the most respected colleges in the country, Haverford College, just announced that they are no longer need-blind in their admissions process due to budgetary concerns. There are very few colleges truly equipped to fund low-income students in a way that doesn't saddle them with debt for the rest of their lives. If income is the new strategy to create diversity, colleges need to do a better job of making the cost of an education more affordable. And, that seems unlikely at most institutions",0

I am left handed and bald, therefore my lack of success is because others stop my success only because of my condition, and has nothing to do with my ability. Just realize that whites happen to succeed, it is a matter of chance not genetics, while others do not. Wait, the 100m track event needs affirmative action! Too many blacks winning, must be racist and needs affirmative action to make whites equally win!",0

The essentials of power, transport, etc are so expensive, and the knockbacks so demoralising and the eventual inertia so debilitating, that sometimes you sink into despondency.

Temporary, empowering. it is depressing being unemployed. working those hours not only give back to the economy, they do wonders for your self esteem and help you back into the work force. these free loaders that use welfare as a way of life as they work under the table are the real problem, and under obama it seems that the handouts have gotten out of control. turning into a welfare state.",0
I don't agree and I don't believe you.,0
I personally know people who get $800+ in food stamps claiming children who do not live with them. They sell them for cash drugs liquor and cigarettes. They sleep all day and party all night. Then their are those who are actually trying to get ahead that are denied any benefits or less than $100 a month help and working 2 to 3 jobs. Need better screening and follow up inspections.,0

Food stamps can not buy booze or cigarettes or lottery tickets so the recipients are allowed to get cash back to purchase those items in Obama's Name of course,0
Or the scammers illegally try to sell them. In CA they are good at fast food restaurants.,0
Most sell them to other fambly that pay 50 cents on a dollar. That money is then used for weed and 24's,0
wrong it is all on e.b.t cards & I have read stories where they are used at casinos !,0
"Good. If I have to work for money and food then so should the leeches of society. Food stamps should really be eliminated totally. Then you'll see unemployment truly drop. If you have kids you can't afford, have no family or friends for help, and need the government to survive, you made poor choices and deserve to live with the consequences.",0

Another attack on Americas poor-> middle class. We need to overall the program but in a positive way requiring recipients complete food and health educational classes monthly to retain benefits while limiting what can be purchased. This program literally costs tax payers 1/10 a penny per year to fund yet provides many with food who need healthy options. It should be about changing bad habits and inter-generational adverse health conditions so that our health care costs go down due to people becoming more healthy.,0

They became active with the JUSTIFIED officer shooting of Mike Brown. And since then every police shooting which they have used as excuses to riot, with the possible exception of 2 or 3, have been found to be JUSTIFIED. And the officers in those UNJUSTIFIED shootings have been convicted. Contrary to your statement, BLM has done tremendous damage to this country in numerous ways. A large segment of Blacks now believe it is socially acceptable to be openly racist, hostile, and aggressive towards random White people, while attacks and assaults on White elderly and helpless people is openly celebrated.",1

"The racism in Israel against blacks, most noticeably Ethiopian Jews, is a travesty but it is no worse than any racial identity that is newly integrated into a society for all of human history. It certainly is not supported by any judicial or legislative body - as unfortunate as this is, it's on humanity as a species more than on Israel as a nation. Israel's treatment of it's Arab citizens on the other hand.... Still, the term genocide DOES NOT apply to any of this and is not a term that should be used lightly.",0

"There is racism in Israel like in every other country, but more reasonable that less... When the question of racism against Ethiopian Jews was raised, Israel proved its ability to fight it with the most effective and vigorous ways.

Not to get into a huge debate; but if there were any descendants of the people of Jericho - I wonder how they would feel about Israel's 'historic claim' to the land. According the bible; the ancient Hebrews slaughtered them wholesale so I guess its a moot point.,0

Who funds BLM? Follow the money!,0
"I do not believe for one moment that police abuse black people. This lie has been repeated so much by politicians and media that it is now accepted as a fact. It is a lie! It is propaganda! This lie has created a dangerous situation that actually ""encourages"" Blacks to behave badly and not be held accountable for their actions. Police exist to protect and defend law-abiding citizens. Believe it or not, that sometimes requires them to fire their weapon to stop criminal maniacs who violently refuse to follow instructions to stand down and stop threatening harm either to the police, innocent citizens, property, or themselves. Blacks do not die more often than whites at the hands of law enforcement; that's a fact that has been proven.",1

"So these thugs are anti-semites. Gee, who would have guessed it.",1
Why would Blacks support Israel? That's not even logical.,0

"Like all good Americans, Dershowitz is deeply concerned when people attack Israel, a sure sign of anti-Semitism – or so he tells us. As a distinguished civil rights attorney, Dershowitz helped defend O J Simpson but he isn’t defending BLM when they have the audacity to go after Israel. And like all Americans nowadays, Dershowitz closely identifies with his chosen group of American born Israelis, BLM identifies with their chosen group of African Americans – if you’re a loyal American you must enlist in a group which despises other groups.

Blacks in America are the fast growing population of anti-Semites in the US. Yes you can fact check it.,1
"Black Lives Matter movement has been racist from the ""Get go"". Racial hatred of Whites and White Cops is wide spread and well known everywhere where Black Lives Matter meet. The members belief that Blacks are being murdered by Cops at a unusually high rate is a false narrative. White people are killed far more by Cops. All Lives Matter! It comes as no surprise that some members hate Jews and Israel too. Just shows that fact that racism and racial hatred is very much alive in the Black Lives Matter movement. People should give the Black Lives Matter movement a double thumbs down and show your displeasure of them.",1
"The terrorist nation of Israel illegally occupies large swaths of the West Bank in direct defiance of International law. Israel should only be approximately 1/3 of the size of what it currently occupies, this means 2/3 of their land is illegally occupied, which is a crime against humanity. Israel somehow managaes to have a worse record for crimes against humanity than even abhorrent places like Iran and Syria. Look it up the information is out there and none of it involves conspiracy nut jobs like Alex Jones.",1
There is no international law against Israel holding the lands they captured in a defensive war. And your claim of a 'worse HR record' than the Arab despots is sheer nonsense. To think that people who can read and write can actually believe anything you've said is beyond comprehension.,0
"Perhaps so but the history of non-Jewish Semites, Muslims, Babylonians (Nebuchadnezzar) and assorted Middle Eastern tribes murdering Jews is long and bloody. But Israel is loyal only to those who defend Jewish interests (Cyrus the Great, a Persian) and violently opposed to those who don’t. Naturally, Israel has a strict immigration policy regarding Palestinians, Israel even built one of those hated Border Walls to keep their nation secure. Is Trump a Jewish name?",0
Palestinkians have an even stricter policy against Jews. The Palestinkian charter calls for the total elimination of the Jewish state and the genocide of Jews.,1

All Arab, Muslim countries and their residents should see and understand this ugly face of racist Hindus. They are the overwhelming majority in India and number of votes cast to BJP-RSS party is a proof . It amazes me that Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries are spending billions on India and not seeing that how much they hate Islam and Muslims? Particularly Arabs, wake up.

"I really like a lot of what you said here. I feel like i can barely speak up about this side of the topic because people are quick to shut down those who try to be too serious about it.  'Anxiety' and 'depression' and 'mental illness' have almost become buzz words. It seems that a lot of people don't know how difficult it is to really suffer and feel out of control of it all.   As you spoke about, there's a fine line these days between awareness and influence. People get ideas in their heads and see the memes and the relateable content and start linking everything to their own lives. Before you know it, you've got perfectly healthy people being tainted by the world and people around them, imposing problems upon themselves and making life more difficult than it needs to be. It desensitises the whole situation and now I have people coming to me with real problems who don't want to speak up because of the upsurge in people talking about it. They feel they wouldn't be taken seriously. And that's horrible.   I do understand though that it's an impossible seesaw to balance since so many people are involved and so many minds with a million ideas and actions are impossible to control and have on the same wave length.",0

My fav part of skimming GG tweets is seeing so many people insist that they are unable to develop their views with experience.,1
"@USER or perhaps twitter's userbase, and humanity at large. Everyone's a jerk sometimes.",1
"like ""i'm feeling bored today, let's hop into this video game and threaten women with some rape""",1
@USER it's mechanical,1
@USER @USER @USER thanks for your opinion!,1
I was working at Cisco when this happened. I remember watching the wording on their website change so they promoted their BSD work.,1
@USER Elegant and beautiful?Cheap and trashy!Nothing more unattractive than girls banging on about how hot hey are. #mkr #notsassy,1
"@USER @USER @USER @USER as someone that's been targeted for a while by these fuckheads, yeah, it is a threat",1
#BlameOneNotAll LINK,1
No. LINK,1
"@USER mostly entertained at how they think it's going to bother me. posted myself in a swimsuit on twitter, obviously give 0 fucks.",1
oh god oh god oh god never point a microscope at skin,1
@USER that is not a question i can answer at this moment in time. :)  the most i can say is that i've been in meetings at twitterhq.,1
"""Women are psychos""

*male tears joke gets made*

""SHUT THE FUCK UP DUMB FEMINAZI BITCH!! THIS IS WHY I NEED MENINISM!!""",1
@USER GDC has been amazing. We've been waiting for this.,1
Am now being forced to watch Garfield videos; luck has changed,1
"&lt;tsui-ji&gt; gyl: go into #asian and tell em you are white, have muscles and drive a nice car and mad chicks will msg you",1
"Well, sis, I miss you. And your predictions were pretty damn close.",1
omg. silicon valley tonight.,1
@USER not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.,1
"For everyone that is involved in this space, there's a huge personal risk. People get targeted. Friends and family get targeted.",1
Not dumb blondes...mmm...perhaps just delusions of adequacy? #MKR,1
@USER but you might ask @USER - i'm pretty sure he does.,1
@USER i met with them weeks ago. :P  who knows what they might do? i certainly don't. but we're talking.,1
"We're being honest with each other, rogue is way too busy harassing people to even start working on a game.",1
"FYGM culture is a real issue. Like, ""I fought my way here, and it sucked, but I'm strong. If you can't do this, it's your problem.""",1
Watching people like @USER further FYGM culture. That's... unfortunate.,1
@USER ouch.,1
"Yo. @USER. I really hate to burst your bubble, but you found a bug in Twitter's UI. The block still exists. &lt;3",1
